# Apple Landing Page

A simple Apple-style landing page built with HTML and CSS.

## What I Built

A responsive landing page with:
- Fixed navigation bar
- Three main sections (promotional content and iPhone showcases)
- Footer with links
- Full-screen background images
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop

## HTML Structure

- **Navigation**: Fixed header with Apple-style menu links
- **Sections**: Three full-height sections for different content
- **Footer**: Multi-column layout with product links and legal info

## CSS Implementation

### Layout
- Used **Flexbox** for centering content and navigation
- Used **CSS Grid** for footer columns
- **Fixed positioning** for sticky navbar
- **Absolute positioning** for background images

### Styling
- **Full viewport height** sections (`min-height: 100vh`)
- **Background images** with `object-fit: cover`
- **Z-index** layering to keep text above images
- **Button styles** with hover effects

### Responsive Design
- **Mobile breakpoint** at 600px
- **Tablet breakpoint** at 900px  
- Navigation hidden on mobile
- Font sizes scale down on smaller screens
- Buttons stack vertically on mobile

## Key CSS Features

- System fonts for better performance
- Smooth transitions on interactive elements
- Apple-inspired color scheme (blue buttons, light backgrounds)
- Proper image scaling and positioning
